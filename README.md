## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Context
Provide clear context about your project, technology stack, and requirements:
```
Use the task-dispatch-director agent to help me migrate my PHP monolith to a Node.js microservices architecture. The current system handles 10k daily users and includes user management, payment processing, and content delivery.
```

### 2. Combine Agents for Complex Tasks
The Task Dispatch Director can coordinate other agents:
```
Use the task-dispatch-director agent to coordinate a complete code review and optimization of my project. I want security analysis, performance improvements, and test coverage enhancement.
```

### 3. Provide Relevant Files and Structure
When possible, mention key files or project structure:
```
Use the flask-api-developer agent to refactor my API in app.py. I want to implement the repository pattern and separate concerns into models, services, and controllers.
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found
If Claude Code reports an agent is not found:
1. Verify installation: `ls ~/.claude/agents`
2. Re-run the installer: `./install.sh`
3. Check file permissions: `chmod 644 ~/.claude/agents/*.md`

### Agent Not Responding as Expected
- Be more specific in your prompt
- Provide additional context about your project
- Try rephrasing your request
